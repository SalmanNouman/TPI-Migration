This is the project repository for the Public Health Inspection Tattoo and Piercing Studio Inspection.
<br>  
NOTE: This project is now part of CC-Open-Learning open-source repository (`https://github.com/CC-Open-Learning/DLX-tattoo-piercing-inspection`)
I am strictly using it to retain my contributions to my github profile as it was part of a broader bitbucket repository library.
